# website-user-behavior-analysis-pm-case
Project-style case study on website user behavior analysis, clustering, and conversion insights, focused on decision-making and product recommendations.

🔍 Project Overview
This repository contains a project-style analytical case study focused on understanding website user behavior, conversion patterns, and opportunities for personalization.
The work was completed as part of a PwC Advisory test task and is presented from a Project / Product decision-making perspective, not just a technical one.

🎯 Business Goals
Understand who comes to the website and how users interact with content
Identify behavioral patterns and barriers to purchase
Find points where personalization and UX changes can improve conversion

🧠 Approach
Analyzed user activity logs over a 3-week period
Performed behavioral clustering using event-based features
Validated differences between user groups using statistical tests
Interpreted results from a business and product perspective

👥 Key User Segments Identified
Passive Users — low engagement, accidental visits
Researchers — high interest, low conversion
Hot Buyers — fast and predictable purchasing behavior
Indecisive Buyers — high intent but drop-off before payment

📊 Key Insights
Conversion behavior differs significantly across clusters (p < 0.001)
Checkout-related actions are the strongest predictors of purchase
Certain user groups show clear opportunities for targeted personalization

💡 Product & Business Recommendations
For each user segment, specific recommendations were proposed, including:
Personalized banners and collections
Simplified checkout flows
Trust-building elements (reviews, comparisons, social proof)
Retargeting and reminder mechanisms
These recommendations are designed to increase conversion without aggressive selling, focusing on user confidence and decision support.

🧩 Why This Project Matters
This case demonstrates:
Structured problem framing
Translation of data insights into business actions
End-to-end thinking: from raw behavior data to product-level decisions
The project reflects a Project Manager mindset with a Product trajectory.
